# Limit test parallelism to avoid macOS fork() issues with Objective-C runtime.
# Our SNMP isolation uses fork() for crash protection, which conflicts with
# macOS's multi-threaded fork safety checks when many threads fork concurrently.
# On Linux (production target), this limit is not needed but is harmless.
